    <!-- Iterators:
    In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination.

    Specifically, an iterator is any object which implements the Iterator protocol by having a next() method that
    returns an object with two properties:
    value:
    The next value in the iteration sequence.

    done:
    This is true if the last value in the sequence has already been consumed. If value is present alongside done, it is
    the iterator's return value. -->

    <!-- Generator functions
While custom iterators are a useful tool, their creation requires careful programming due to the need to explicitly
maintain their internal state. Generator functions provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative
algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous. Generator functions are written using the
function* syntax.

When called, generator functions do not initially execute their code. Instead, they return a special type of iterator,
called a Generator. When a value is consumed by calling the generator's next method, the Generator function executes
until it encounters the yield keyword. -->

<!-- 
Iterables
An object is iterable if it defines its iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a for...of construct.
Some built-in types, such as Array or Map, have a default iteration behavior, while other types (such as Object) do not.

In order to be iterable, an object must implement the @@iterator method. This means that the object (or one of the
objects up its prototype chain) must have a property with a Symbol.iterator key.

It may be possible to iterate over an iterable more than once, or only once. It is up to the programmer to know which is the case.

Iterables which can iterate only once (such as Generators) customarily return this from their @@iterator method, whereas
iterables which can be iterated many times must return a new iterator on each invocation of @@iterator.

            console.log(result.value); // 1 3 5 7 9
            result = it.next();
        }
        console.log("Iterated over sequence of size:", result.value); // [5 numbers returned, that took interval in between: 0 to 10]

            let iterationCount = 0;

                iterationCount++;
