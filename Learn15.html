    <!--     
    sometimes we receive a raw JSON string, and we need to convert it to an object ourselves. And when we want to send a
    JavaScript object across the network, we need to convert it to JSON (a string) before sending it. Luckily, these two
    problems are so common in web development that a built-in JSON object is available in browsers, which contains the
    following two methods:

    parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.

    stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string. 
-->
    <!-- 
    we retrieve the response as text rather than JSON, by calling the text() method of the response
    we then use parse() to convert the text to a JavaScript object.
    async function populate() {
        const requestURL =
          "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";
        const request = new Request(requestURL);
      
        const response = await fetch(request);
        const superHeroesText = await response.text();
      
        const superHeroes = JSON.parse(superHeroesText);
        populateHeader(superHeroes);
        populateHeroes(superHeroes);
      }
       -->
    <!-- As you might guess, stringify() works the opposite way. Try entering the following lines into your browser's
    JavaScript console one by one to see it in action:
    let myObj = { name: "Chris", age: 38 };
    myObj;
    let myString = JSON.stringify(myObj);
    myString; -->
