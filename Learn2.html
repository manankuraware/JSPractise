    <!-- 
    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
    time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely
    content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
    jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.


    APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to
    implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
    They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for
    home building 
    
    1.Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to
    expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex
    things. For example:
    
            The DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML,
            dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new
            content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.
    
            The Geolocation API retrieves geographical information
    
            The Canvas and WebGL APIs allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.
    
            Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia,
            such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone
            else's computer

    2.Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example:
            
            The Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.

            The Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap API allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.


        
    Scripts loaded using the async attribute will download the script without blocking the page while the script is
    being
    fetched. However, once the download is complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page from rendering. This
    means that the rest of the content on the web page is prevented from being processed and displayed to the user until
    the
    script finishes executing.

    Scripts loaded with the defer attribute will load in the order they appear on the page. They won't run until the
    page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place
    -->

    <script>
        let myNumber = "500"; // oops, this is still a string
        console.log(typeof myNumber);
        myNumber = 500; // much better — now this is a number
        console.log(typeof myNumber);
    </script>
</body>
