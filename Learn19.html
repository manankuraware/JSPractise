    <!-- Object and Map compared
    Traditionally, objects have been used to map strings to values. Objects allow you to set keys to values, retrieve
    those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Map objects, however, have a few more
    advantages that make them better maps.
    -->
    <!--     
    These three tips can help you to decide whether to use a Map or an Object:

    Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.  -->

    <!-- Use maps if there is a need to store primitive values as keys because object treats each key as a string whether
    it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value. -->

    <!-- Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements. -->
    <script>
        // A Map object is a simple key/value map and can iterate its elements in insertion order.
        const sayings = new Map();
        sayings.set("dog", "woof");
        sayings.set("cat", "meow");
        sayings.set("elephant", "toot");
        sayings.size; // 3
        sayings.get("dog"); // woof
        sayings.get("fox"); // undefined
        sayings.has("bird"); // false
        sayings.delete("dog");
        sayings.has("dog"); // false
        for (const [key, value] of sayings) {
            console.log(`${key} goes ${value}`);
        }
        // "cat goes meow"
        // "elephant goes toot"
        sayings.clear();
        sayings.size; // 0

        //         Set object
        // Set objects are collections of unique values. You can iterate its elements in insertion order. 
        // A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.
        const mySet = new Set();
        mySet.add(1);
        mySet.add("some text");
        mySet.add("foo");

        mySet.has(1); // true
        mySet.delete("foo");
        mySet.size; // 2

        for (const item of mySet) {
            console.log(item);
        }
        // 1
        // "some text"

        // You can create an Array from a Set using Array.from or the spread syntax. Also, the Set constructor accepts an Array to convert in the other direction.


        // Array and Set compared
// Traditionally, a set of elements has been stored in arrays in JavaScript in a lot of situations. The Set object, however, has some advantages:

// Deleting Array elements by value (arr.splice(arr.indexOf(val), 1)) is very slow.
// Set objects let you delete elements by their value. With an array, you would have to splice based on an element's index.
// The value NaN cannot be found with indexOf in an array.
// Set objects store unique values. You don't have to manually keep track of duplicates.
