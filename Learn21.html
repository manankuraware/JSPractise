    <!-- To achieve maximum flexibility and efficiency, JavaScript typed arrays split the implementation into buffers and
    views. A buffer is an object representing a chunk of data; it has no format to speak of, and offers no mechanism for
    accessing its contents. In order to access the memory contained in a buffer, you need to use a view. A view provides
    a context — that is, a data type, starting offset, and number of elements. -->

    <!-- Buffers:
    There are two types of buffers: ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer. Both are low-level representations of a memory
    span. They have "array" in their names, but they don't have much to do with arrays — you cannot read or write to
    them directly. Instead, buffers are generic objects that just contain raw data. In order to access the memory
    represented by a buffer, you need to use a view. -->

    <!-- The difference between ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer is that the former is always owned by a single execution
    context at a time. If you pass an ArrayBuffer to a different execution context, it is transferred and the original
    ArrayBuffer becomes unusable. This ensures that only one execution context can access the memory at a time. A
    SharedArrayBuffer is not transferred when passed to a different execution context, so it can be accessed by multiple
    execution contexts at the same time. -->

    <!-- Views:
    There are currently two main kinds of views: typed array views and DataView. Typed arrays provide utility methods
    that allow you to conveniently transform binary data. DataView is more low-level and allows granular control of how
    data is accessed.
