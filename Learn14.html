    <!-- 
    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on
    JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data
    from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
    
    Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and
    many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.

    JSON exists as a string — useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It needs to be converted to a
    native JavaScript object when you want to access the data.

    JSON structure:
    {
  "squadName": "Super hero squad",
  "homeTown": "Metro City",
  "formed": 2016,
  "secretBase": "Super tower",
  "active": true,
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "Molecule Man",
      "age": 29,
      "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
      "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Madame Uppercut",
      "age": 39,
      "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
      "powers": [
        "Million tonne punch",
        "Damage resistance",
        "Superhuman reflexes"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Eternal Flame",
      "age": 1000000,
      "secretIdentity": "Unknown",
      "powers": [
        "Immortality",
        "Heat Immunity",
        "Inferno",
        "Teleportation",
        "Interdimensional travel"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
If we loaded this string into a JavaScript program and parsed it into a variable called superHeroes 
for example, we could then access the data inside it using the same dot/bracket notation
superHeroes.homeTown;
superHeroes["active"];
superHeroes["members"][1]["powers"][2];
First, we have the variable name — superHeroes.
Inside that, we want to access the members property, so we use ["members"].
members contains an array populated by objects. We want to access the second object inside the array, so we use [1].
Inside this object, we want to access the powers property, so we use ["powers"].
Inside the powers property is an array containing the selected hero's superpowers. We want the third one, so we use [2].

Arrays as JSON:
We can also convert arrays to/from JSON
[
  {
    "name": "Molecule Man",
    "age": 29,
    "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
    "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Madame Uppercut",
    "age": 39,
    "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
    "powers": [
      "Million tonne punch",
      "Damage resistance",
      "Superhuman reflexes"
    ]
  }
]
The above is perfectly valid JSON. You'd just have to access array items (in its parsed version) 
by starting with an array index, for example [0]["powers"][0].
