    <title>Regular Expression in Js</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions
    are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(),
    matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript
    regular expressions. -->

    <!-- Method Description
    exec() Executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch.
    test() Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false.
    match() Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found.
    matchAll() Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.
    search() Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
    replace() Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement
    substring.
    replaceAll() Executes a search for all matches in a string, and replaces the matched substrings with a replacement
    substring.
    split() Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings. -->

        // Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:
        const re = /ab+c/;
        // Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

        // Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows
        const rey = new RegExp("ab+c");
        // Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know 
        // the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.

        const myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec("cdbbdbsbz");
        // similar to 'cdbbdbsbz'.match(/d(b+)d/g); however,
        // 'cdbbdbsbz'.match(/d(b+)d/g) outputs [ "dbbd" ]
        // while /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ]
