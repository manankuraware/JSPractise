<!-- 
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so
the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a
prototype that has null for its own prototype.

When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is
searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on
until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.

<!-- What is the prototype for myObject? To find out, we can use the function: Object.getPrototypeOf(myObject); -->

<body>
    <script>
        // The prototype of an object is not always Object.prototype. Try this
        const myDate = new Date();
        let object = myDate;

        do {
            object = Object.getPrototypeOf(object);
            console.log(object);
        } while (object);

        // This code creates a Date object, then walks up the prototype chain, logging the prototypes.
        // It shows us that the prototype of myDate is a Date.prototype object, and the prototype of that 
        // is Object.prototype.

        //         Shadowing properties
        // What happens if you define a property in an object, when a property with the same name is defined in the 
        // object's prototype? Let's see:

        // const myDate = new Date(1995, 11, 17);
        // console.log(myDate.getYear()); // 95
        // myDate.getYear = function () {
        //     console.log("something else!");
        // };
        // myDate.getYear(); 

        // This should be predictable, given the description of the prototype chain.When we call getYear() the browser 
        // first looks in myDate for a property with that name, and only checks the prototype if myDate does not define it.
        // So when we add getYear() to myDate, then the version in myDate is called.
        // This is called "shadowing" the property.

        // Setting a prototype
        // There are various ways of setting an object's prototype in JavaScript, and here we'll describe two: 
        // Object.create() and constructors.

        // Using Object.create
        // The Object.create() method creates a new object and allows you to specify an object that will be used as 
        // the new object's prototype.

        // const personPrototype = {
        //     greet() {
        //         console.log("hello! baccho");
        //     },
        // };

        // const carl = Object.create(personPrototype);
        // carl.greet(); 
        // Here we create an object personPrototype, which has a greet() method. We then use Object.create() to 
        // create a new object with personPrototype as its prototype. Now we can call greet() on the new object, and 
        // the prototype provides its implementation.

        // Using a constructor
        // In JavaScript, all functions have a property named prototype. When you call a function as a constructor, 
        // this property is set as the prototype of the newly constructed object (by convention, in the property 
        // named __proto__).
        const personPrototype = {
            greet() {
                console.log(`hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
            },
        };

        function Person(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        Object.assign(Person.prototype, personPrototype);
        // or
        // Person.prototype.greet = personPrototype.greet;

        // Here we create:
        // an object personPrototype, which has a greet() method
        // a Person() constructor function which initializes the name of the person to create.
        // We then put the methods defined in personPrototype onto the Person function's prototype property using Object.assign.
        // After this code, objects created using Person() will get Person.prototype as their prototype, which automatically contains the greet method.

        const reuben = new Person("Manan");
        console.log(reuben.greet());
