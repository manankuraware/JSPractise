    <!-- Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you
    to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function. 
    // Animal properties and method encapsulation
const Animal = {
  type: "Invertebrates", // Default value of properties
  displayType() {
    // Method which will display type of Animal
    console.log(this.type);
  },
};

// Create new animal type called animal1
const animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType(); // Logs: Invertebrates

// Create new animal type called fish
const fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = "Fishes";
fish.displayType(); // Logs: Fishes

    <!-- 
Enumerating properties
There are three native ways to list/traverse object properties:

for...in loops. This method traverses all of the enumerable string properties of an object as well as its prototype chain.
Object.keys(). This method returns an array with only the enumerable own string property names ("keys") in the object myObj, but not those in the prototype chain.
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(). This method returns an array containing all the own string property names in the object myObj, regardless of if they are enumerable or not. 
-->

    <!-- All objects in JavaScript inherit from at least one other object. The object being inherited from is known as the prototype, and the inherited properties can be found 
    in the prototype object of the constructor. -->


<!-- Defining getters and setters
const myObj = {
  a: 7,
  get b() {
    return this.a + 1;
  },
  set c(x) {
    this.a = x / 2;
  },
};

console.log(myObj.a); // 7
console.log(myObj.b); // 8, returned from the get b() method
myObj.c = 50; // Calls the set c(x) method
console.log(myObj.a); // 25

Getters and setters can also be added to an object at any time after creation using the Object.defineProperties() 
method. This method's first parameter is the object on which you want to define the getter or setter. The second 
parameter is an object whose property names are the getter or setter names, and whose property values are 
objects for defining the getter or setter functions.

const myObj = { a: 0 };

Object.defineProperties(myObj, {
  b: {
    get() {
      return this.a + 1;
    },
  },
  c: {
    set(x) {
      this.a = x / 2;
    },
  },
});

myObj.c = 10; // Runs the setter, which assigns 10 / 2 (5) to the 'a' property
console.log(myObj.b); // Runs the getter, which yields a + 1 or 6
